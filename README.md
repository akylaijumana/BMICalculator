``Body Mass Index (BMI)``
Definition: BMI is a numerical value derived from an individual's weight and height, used to categorize them into different weight status categories. It provides a quick assessment of body fatness and helps identify potential health risks associated with being underweight, overweight, or obese.

``Calculation``
The formula for calculating BMI is:

BMI=weight/(height)^2

``Weight:`` Measure in kilograms (kg).
``Height:`` Measure in meters (m).
``Calculation Example:`` For someone weighing 70 kg and 1.75 m tall:
BMI=70 /(1.75)^2≈22.86

```BMI Categories```
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the following BMI categories:

``Underweight:`` Less than 18.5

May indicate malnutrition, eating disorders, or other health issues.
``Normal Weight: ``18.5 to 24.9

Generally associated with lower health risks.
``Overweight:`` 25 to 29.9

Increased risk of health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension.
``Obesity:`` 30 or greater

``Conclusion``
BMI is a useful tool for identifying individuals who may be at risk for health issues due to their weight. 
However, it should be used alongside other assessments and health evaluations for a more comprehensive understanding of an individual’s health status.
Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
